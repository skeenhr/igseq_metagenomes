###FastQC is used to quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines.
###MultiQC is a reporting tool that parses results and statistics from bioinformatics tool outputs, such as log files and console outputs. It helps to summarise experiments containing multiple samples and multiple analysis steps.

##STEP 1 OF MG ANALYSIS
#1. In the terminal, navigate to folder with all raw data files
#2. Run the following code:

module load fastqc/"VERSION"
mkdir fastqc_results
fastqc -o fastqc_results -t 6 igseq_meta_raw/*.fastq.gz  

##STEP 2 OF MG ANALYSIS
#3. navitate to fastqc_results folder
#4. Run the following code:

multiqc .

#5. view results from the multiqc.html file
